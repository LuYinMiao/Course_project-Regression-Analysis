Modern smartphones offer various features like processing power, memory, camera quality, and display resolution, all of which impact user experience and pricing.Therefore, we used linear regression to analyze the impact of these factors on smartphone pricing. We performed extensive data preprocessing, visualization, and applied the k-fold method to select the best linear regression model, also conducting hypothesis testing for validation. Our approach is clear and effective, providing a reliable method for users to choose the right smartphone.
